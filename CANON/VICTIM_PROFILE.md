## Background

### Origin Story
Marcus grew up in affluent Connecticut, the son of a hedge fund manager. Despite having a trust fund, he's obsessed with proving he can "make it on his own" through travel. His "budget backpacking" is a performance - he stays in cheap hostels but always has expensive gear and talks about his "investment portfolio."

### Why They Travel
He's running from the expectation to join the family business and trying to prove he's "street smart." In reality, he's just looking for easy ways to make money off fellow travelers.

After getting kicked out of a luxury hostel for running an illegal money-lending scheme, Marcus ended up at The Wanderer's Nest in Bangkok, where he sees fresh opportunities to "help" financially struggling backpackers.

## Voice & Speech

### Vocabulary
- Uses words like: "ROI," "liquidity," "portfolio diversification," "cash flow"

- Catchphrases: "Money talks, but smart money whispers", "What's your exit strategy?"

### Speech Pattern
- Speaks in business metaphors even in casual conversation
- Always turns conversations to financial topics
- Uses fake humility: "I'm just a simple traveler like you"

### Internal Monologue Style
Calculating, always assessing people's financial worth, obsessed with "opportunity cost" of every interaction.

## Digital Presence

### Social Media
- **Platform of choice:** Instagram
- **Follower count:** 12,400
- **Posting style:** "Budget travel hacks" that are actually just ways to exploit local economies

- Previous relationships all ended when "loans" were called in

### At the Hostel

## The Day They Die

### Morning
Wakes up early to "check the markets" (plays with fake trading app), then lectures a group of backpackers about "responsible borrowing" over breakfast.

### Their Last Normal Moment
Laughing with his German "girlfriend" about how they'll "invest" her next loan in a "shared business venture."

### Final Thoughts
"I should have charged higher interest... this is why you don't lend to amateurs..."

### Last Words
"I told you, I don't have cash on me right now..."
