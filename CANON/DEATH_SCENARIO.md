# Death Scenario

## The Death (Summary)
**Method:** Stabbed multiple times with a broken beer bottle
**Category:** Murder (Circumstantial - born from financial desperation)
**Duration:** 3-5 minutes of struggle
**Witnesses:** None (but heard by several who ignore it)

## Mechanism (Technical)

### The Cause
Exsanguination from multiple deep lacerations to the torso and neck, caused by the jagged edge of a broken Chang beer bottle. The victim bleeds out in the cramped staircase.

### The Setup
1. Marcus has been running an informal lending scheme at the hostel
2. He's lent money to several backpackers at exorbitant interest rates
3. One borrower, Jake (Australian, 22), has fallen behind on payments
4. Jake's visa is about to expire and he needs $200 to extend it
5. Marcus refuses, citing "bad credit history" and "risk assessment"

### The Trigger
Jake, desperate and humiliated in front of other backpackers, snaps when Marcus publicly shames him for "poor financial planning" during a rooftop party.

### The Process
[Step by step: How does the death unfold from trigger to end]

1. **The Argument**: Jake confronts Marcus in the common area, begging for the $200
2. **Public Humiliation**: Marcus loudly refuses, making a scene about "responsible lending"
3. **The Chase**: Jake, enraged, follows Marcus up the staircase, demanding the money
4. **Point of No Return**: Marcus tries to escape to his "premium" dorm but Jake blocks his path
5. **The Struggle**: In the cramped staircase, Jake grabs a beer bottle from the landing and smashes it
6. **The First Strike**: Jake slashes at Marcus's arm when he tries to push past
7. **The Panic**: Marcus realizes this isn't just a threat - Jake is genuinely out of control
8. **The Fatal Blows**: In a frenzy, Jake stabs Marcus multiple times in the torso and neck
9. **The Collapse**: Marcus slides down the wall, leaving a bloody trail on the peeling travel stickers
10. **The Aftermath**: Jake, in shock, flees down the fire escape as Marcus bleeds out

## The Death Sequence (Full Detail)

### Setup (Chapter 35-37)
The hostel is having one of its infamous "Full Moon Lite" parties on the rooftop. Marcus is holding court, giving financial advice to a group of new backpackers. Jake has been drinking heavily and becomes increasingly agitated as Marcus ignores his requests for the $200 loan.

### Trigger (Chapter 38)
When Jake publicly asks for the money, Marcus responds with: "Jake, my friend, if I gave money to everyone with poor financial planning, I'd be broke! Maybe you should have thought about your cash flow before blowing your budget on Chang beer and ladyboys!" The crowd laughs, but Jake's face darkens.

### The Death (Chapters 39-40)
Write this sequence in full detail:

**Minute 0:**
Jake stands up abruptly, knocking over his beer. "You think this is funny, you rich prick?" The music stops. Marcus, sensing the mood shift, tries to laugh it off: "Easy there, mate. We can talk about this tomorrow when you're sober."

**Minute 1-2:**
Jake lunges at Marcus, who barely dodges and bolts for the staircase - his usual escape route. Jake follows, screaming "You'll give me that fucking money!" Several backpackers watch but no one intervenes. This is just "backpacker drama."

**Minute 3-5 (The Struggle):**
In the dimly lit staircase, Jake corners Marcus on the landing between the 2nd and 3rd floors. "Give. Me. The. Money." Marcus, now genuinely frightened, stammers "I-I don't have cash on me, it's in my locker, I'll get it tomorrow, I swear!" Jake doesn't believe him. He grabs an empty Chang bottle from the landing and smashes it against the wall. The jagged edge glints in the dim light.

**Minute 6-8 (The Attack):**
Marcus tries to push past Jake, but Jake slashes at his arm, drawing first blood. Marcus screams - a sound that's disturbingly high-pitched for such a large man. He tries to escape up the stairs but Jake tackles him. They struggle on the narrow landing, Marcus kicking and screaming, Jake stabbing wildly with the broken bottle.

**Final Moment (The Death):**
Marcus feels the warm blood pouring down his chest as Jake lands the final blows to his neck. His vision blurs as he slides down the wall, the peeling travel stickers sticking to his bloody back. His last thought is ironic: "I should have invested in better travel insurance..." His last words are a gurgled "I... can pay you... back... with interest..."

### Immediate Aftermath
Jake stands over Marcus's body, breathing heavily. The staircase is a scene from a horror movie - blood splattered on the walls, mixing with the existing grime. Jake, in a panic, wipes the bottle on his shirt and flees down the fire escape. Meanwhile, on the rooftop, the party continues. Someone says "Sounds like someone's having a bad trip" as distant screams echo. No one investigates.

## Sensory Details

### Sight
- The victim sees: Jake's crazed eyes reflecting the dim staircase light, the jagged bottle coming toward him, his own blood spraying on the peeling travel stickers
- The scene looks like: A horror movie set - the grimy staircase now slick with blood, the flickering fluorescent light casting eerie shadows

### Sound
- The victim hears: Jake's enraged screaming, his own panicked breathing, the shattering of glass, the wet sounds of stabbing, his own gurgled attempts to speak
- Others hear: Muffled screams and thuds, but assume it's just "backpacker drama"

### Touch/Pain
- The initial slash feels like fire across his forearm
- Each stab is a white-hot poker of pain
- The final neck wounds bring a strange numbness as the blood loss sets in
- The sticky peeling wallpaper against his back as he slides down

### Smell
- The metallic tang of his own blood
- Jake's sweat and cheap alcohol breath
- The underlying hostel stench of urine and cleaning products

### Taste
- The coppery taste of blood in his mouth
- The bitter taste of regret

## The Horror Element
The true horror isn't just the violent death, but the realization that in this hostel, no one cares. The screams are ignored, the blood will be cleaned up by morning, and life (and death) will go on. The hostel itself is the real monster - an ecosystem where this was inevitable.

## The Comedy Element
- Marcus's last thoughts are about money and interest rates
- His expensive smartwatch gets stolen off his wrist as he bleeds out
- The party continues upstairs while he dies
- His final words are still trying to negotiate the loan
