```

### The Death Location (Specific)
**Where exactly does the death occur?**
In the cramped, poorly-lit staircase between the 2nd and 3rd floors. The area is known for "private conversations" and has terrible cell reception. The walls are covered in peeling travel stickers and the faint scent of urine lingers permanently.

### Smells

## The Staff

### Reception
**Name:** Somchai (but everyone calls him "Sleepy")
**Description:** Mid-40s, perpetually tired, speaks minimal English but excellent "international body language"
**Role in death:** Oblivious - he's seen it all and assumes any screams are just "backpacker drama"

### Other Staff
| Role | Name | Notable Trait |
|------|------|---------------|
| Cleaner | Nok | Knows all the hostel secrets but never speaks
| Security | Big Tony | Former boxer, looks scary but is actually harmless
| Bar/Kitchen | Dao | The only one who cares, tries to keep people safe
| Manager | Khun Peter | Australian expat, more interested in his online poker than the hostel

### Staff Knowledge
They've all heard rumors about "incidents" in the staircase but no one acknowledges them. The unofficial policy is "what happens at The Nest, stays at The Nest."

## Hostel Atmosphere

### Day Vibe
A mix of hungover backpackers and new arrivals. The common room has a tense energy as people negotiate shared spaces and debts.

### Night Vibe
Chaotic party energy on the rooftop, but the stairwells become eerie and dangerous. The hostel transforms into a place where anything can happen.

### Guest Demographics
- 60% party backpackers
- 20% spiritual seekers
- 15% long-term residents (the ones you should worry about)
- 5% people running from something

### Reputation
"The place where your travel stories get dark." Known for:
- Cheap drinks
- No questions asked
- "Character building experiences"
- The staircase everyone warns you about

## Practical Details

### Getting There
Most arrive by tuk-tuk from Khao San Road. The driver always says "You sure about this place?" but takes them anyway for the commission.

### Check-in Process
"Sign here, pay cash, don't ask questions." No ID required if you "look trustworthy" (a dangerous judgment call).

### Rules
- No drugs (wink wink)
- Quiet hours 3-6 AM (ignored)
- "Be cool to each other" (vaguely threatening)
- What happens at The Nest stays at The Nest (unofficial but enforced)

### Amenities
- [X] Wi-Fi (quality: terrible but free)
- [X] Kitchen (quality: questionable hygiene)
- [ ] Lockers (broken since 2012)
- [ ] Laundry ("just wash it in the sink")
- [ ] Pool ("the shower is your pool")
- [X] Bar (quality: cheap and strong)
- [X] Rooftop (quality: dangerous but great views)
- [ ] Tours offered ("just go outside")
- [X] Other: "Atmosphere" (if you consider desperation atmospheric)
