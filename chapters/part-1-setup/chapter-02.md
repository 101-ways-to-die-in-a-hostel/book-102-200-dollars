# Chapter 2: The House Always Wins

**POV:** Marcus Calloway / Jake (dual perspective)
**Location:** The Wanderer's Nest, Bangkok
**Timeline:** Day 2-3, Various Times
**Word Target:** 5,500

## Day 2: The Morning After

Marcus woke to the sound of retching. He opened his eyes to see one of his new dorm-mates, a pasty-faced Brit named Colin, hunched over a bucket.

"Rough night?" Marcus asked, checking his smartwatch. 6:47 AM. Too early for this.

"Fucking moonshine," Colin groaned. "Never again."

Marcus smiled. *Perfect.* "You know," he said casually, "I could help you out with that. For a small fee, of course."

## The Breakfast Club (of Desperation)

Downstairs in the "kitchen" (a questionable term for the grease-covered space), Marcus found his next targets. A German couple arguing over money, a Swedish girl who'd lost her wallet, and Jake, looking worse than Colin.

"Morning, team!" Marcus announced, pouring himself a cup of what passed for coffee. "Who needs financial advice with their breakfast?"

By the time he finished his "consultations," he'd added three more "clients" to his roster:
- **Lena** (Swedish, 22): $150 for a "emergency" flight home (50% interest)
- **Hans & Greta** (German, 28 & 26): $300 to cover "unexpected visa fees" (30% interest)
- **Colin** (British, 21): $80 for "medical expenses" (a.k.a. more moonshine) (100% interest)

"You're a saint," Lena said, signing the napkin contract.

"Just good business," Marcus corrected. "Everyone wins."

## Jake's Descent

**POV Switch: Jake's Perspective**

Jake watched from the corner as Marcus pocketed another signed napkin. The bastard was good - too good. In just 24 hours, he'd turned the hostel into his personal ATM.

"You look like someone who could use a drink," Dao said, sliding a Chang beer across the bar to him.

"I look like someone who's fucked," Jake muttered, taking a long swig. The beer tasted bitter, or maybe that was just his mood.

"Money troubles?" Dao asked, already knowing the answer.

"You could say that," Jake admitted. "I owe that Moneybags prick $200, and my transfer isn't coming through."

Dao leaned in. "Let me give you some advice, free of charge. That staircase? The one between second and third floor? Stay away from it after dark."

Jake laughed humorlessly. "You sound like my grandma with her superstitions."

"It's not superstition," Dao said seriously. "Bad things happen there. People... disappear."

Jake rolled his eyes, but a chill ran down his spine.

## The Pool Hall Hustle

**POV: Marcus**

The hostel's "game room" was just a broken pool table and some card tables, but to Marcus, it was a goldmine. He'd organized a "friendly" poker game, with the house (him) taking a 10% rake.

"You're cheating," Jake accused after losing his third hand in a row.

"Just lucky," Marcus said, pocketing Jake's last $20. "But since you're a good sport, I'll spot you another $50. 25% interest, payable Friday."

Jake's hands clenched into fists, but he nodded. "Fine. But I want a rematch."

"Anytime," Marcus said, already scanning the room for his next mark.

## The German "Investment"

Hans cornered Marcus in the hallway. "We need to talk about our... arrangement," he said, glancing nervously at his girlfriend Greta.

"Of course!" Marcus said, clapping him on the back. "Let's take this to my office." He led them to the rooftop, where the noise would cover their conversation.

"We can't pay the interest," Hans admitted. "We thought we'd have work by now."

Marcus made a show of thinking. "I understand. How about this - you work for me. Run errands, collect payments, that sort of thing. I'll reduce your interest to 15%."

Greta's eyes lit up. "Really? That would be amazing!"

"One condition," Marcus said, holding up a finger. "You can't tell anyone about our new arrangement. Confidentiality is key in business."

They agreed eagerly. *Perfect,* Marcus thought. *Now I have enforcers.*

## The Staircase Incident

**POV: Jake**

Jake was on his way to the bathroom when he heard it - a scream from the staircase. He froze, then cautiously approached.

On the second-floor landing, he saw Colin, pale and shaking, staring at something on the wall.

"What happened?" Jake asked.

"I... I saw something," Colin stammered. "In the shadows. It had... eyes."

Jake rolled his eyes. "You're still drunk, mate."

"No!" Colin insisted. "There's something wrong with this place. Something... hungry."

Jake was about to laugh when he noticed the graffiti on the wall: "PAID IN FULL" in what looked like dried blood.

## Marcus's Nightly Routine

**POV: Marcus**

Marcus sat on his bunk, updating his spreadsheet. The numbers were beautiful:
- **Total lent**: $730
- **Weekly interest**: $182.50
- **Projected defaults**: 60%
- **Estimated profit**: $420/week

*Not bad for a backpacker,* he thought.

His phone buzzed. A message from his mother: "Darling, are you being safe?"

Marcus snorted. *Safe? In this place?* He typed back: "Never safer, Mom. Making great investments!"

## The First Collection

Friday rolled around, and Marcus made his rounds. Colin paid up (barely), Lena begged for an extension (granted, with higher interest), but Jake... Jake was nowhere to be found.

"He's avoiding you," Hans reported. "Says he can't pay."

Marcus's smile didn't reach his eyes. "Find him. Remind him of our agreement."

## The Chapter Cliffhanger

As Marcus counted his earnings that night, he heard a noise outside his dorm. The door creaked open, and there stood Jake, eyes wild, holding a broken beer bottle.

"We need to talk," Jake said, his voice dangerously calm.

"Of course," Marcus said, forcing a smile. "Let's discuss this like civilized people."

Jake's grip tightened on the bottle. "I don't feel very civilized right now."
