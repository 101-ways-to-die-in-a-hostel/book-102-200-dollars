# Chapter 1: The Money Man Arrives

**POV:** Marcus Calloway
**Location:** The Wanderer's Nest, Bangkok
**Timeline:** Day 1, 3:17 PM
**Word Target:** 5,500

## The Tuk-Tuk Ride from Hell

The tuk-tuk driver's words echoed in Marcus's mind as they careened through Bangkok's chaotic streets: "You sure about this place, mister?"

Marcus adjusted his sunglasses, the late afternoon sun glinting off his expensive smartwatch. "Positive," he said, though the driver's hesitation made him glance at the hostel's online reviews one more time. *"Authentic backpacker experience," "character-building," "not for the faint of heart."* Perfect.

As they turned onto the narrow alley, Marcus caught his first glimpse of The Wanderer's Nest. The four-story concrete monstrosity loomed ahead, its once-white walls now a canvas of graffiti and peeling paint. Neon signs flickered in the humidity: "CHEAP BEDS," "COLD BEER," "NO QUESTIONS."

"Here we are," the driver announced, pulling up to what passed for a curb. "Twenty baht extra for the... atmosphere."

Marcus rolled his eyes but paid. As he stepped out, the oppressive Bangkok heat hit him like a wall. The air smelled of exhaust, street food, and something faintly rotten beneath it all.

## Check-In: "Sign Here, Don't Ask Questions"

The hostel's "reception" was little more than a scarred wooden desk with a handwritten sign: "RING BELL FOR SERVICE." Marcus rang. Nothing. He rang again. Still nothing.

"Can I help you?" A voice came from behind him. Marcus turned to see a man who looked like he'd been napping - rumpled clothes, half-closed eyes, a name tag that read "Sleepy."

"Checking in," Marcus said, sliding his reservation confirmation across the desk. "Marcus Calloway. Premium dorm, paid in advance."

Sleepy barely glanced at the paper. "Passport?"

"I don't carry it with me," Marcus lied. "Security risk."

Sleepy shrugged. "You look trustworthy. Sign here." He pushed a guestbook across the desk. The pages were filled with scribbles, doodles, and the occasional obscenity.

As Marcus signed, he noticed an entry above his: "If you're reading this, GET OUT WHILE YOU CAN - Jake." He chuckled. Dramatic backpackers.

"Room 304," Sleepy said, handing him a key attached to a plastic bottle cap. "Third floor. Elevator's broken. Wi-Fi password is 'trustno1.' Breakfast 8-10. Rules are..." He pointed to a wall covered in handwritten rules, most of which had been crossed out or amended.

"Got it," Marcus said, already scanning the common room. *Opportunities everywhere.*

## The Common Room: A Hunter's Paradise

The common area was exactly what Marcus had hoped for - a mix of wide-eyed new arrivals and road-worn backpackers, all looking like they could use some "financial guidance."

A group of Australians were arguing over a map. A German girl with dreadlocks nursed what looked like her third Chang beer. In the corner, a guy who looked like he hadn't slept in days was frantically typing on a laptop.

Marcus's smartwatch buzzed - a notification from his fake trading app. He made a show of checking it, then casually adjusted his Patagonia vest to ensure the logo was visible.

"First time at The Nest?" A voice came from behind him. Marcus turned to see a tall Australian with a week's worth of stubble and bloodshot eyes.

"First time in Bangkok, actually," Marcus said, extending his hand. "Marcus. But everyone calls me Moneybags."

The Australian raised an eyebrow but shook his hand. "Jake. And I can see why they call you that." He eyed Marcus's watch. "That's, what, a $500 watch? In this place?"

Marcus laughed. "It's about knowing where to invest. Speaking of which..." He lowered his voice conspiratorially. "I couldn't help but overhear you mentioning visa troubles earlier?"

Jake's face darkened. "Yeah. Need to extend, but the bastards want 200 bucks."

*Jackpot,* Marcus thought. "Funny you should mention that amount," he said smoothly. "I actually specialize in helping travelers with... short-term financial solutions."

## The First "Investment"

Five minutes later, Marcus had his first Bangkok "client." Jake had eagerly accepted a "micro-loan" of $200 at what Marcus called "a very reasonable" 20% weekly interest.

"Just until my next transfer comes through," Jake said, signing the hastily drawn-up contract on a napkin.

"Of course," Marcus said, pocketing the signed napkin. "We're all travelers here. Got to look out for each other."

As Jake walked away, Marcus pulled out his phone and updated his "investment tracker" spreadsheet. *$200 principal, $40 weekly interest, 90% probability of default.* He grinned. The defaults were where the real money was made.

## The Staircase Warning

Dorm assignment in hand, Marcus headed for the infamous staircase. The moment he stepped onto the first stair, he understood why the tuk-tuk driver had been concerned.

The staircase was narrow, dimly lit, and smelled like a mix of urine, cheap alcohol, and something metallic. The walls were covered in peeling travel stickers, graffiti, and what looked suspiciously like old bloodstains.

Halfway up, he noticed a particularly ominous piece of graffiti: "Money can't buy you love... or safety." Marcus snorted. *Amateurs.*

As he reached the second-floor landing, he heard a sound behind him. He turned to see the hostel cleaner, a small Thai woman, shaking her head and muttering something in Thai. She made a gesture like she was washing her hands of something.

"Problem?" Marcus asked.

The woman - her name tag read "Nok" - just shook her head and continued down the stairs, avoiding the third-floor landing entirely.

*Superstitious locals,* Marcus thought, continuing upward. *What do they know about real risk assessment?*

## The "Premium" Dorm

Room 304 was, generously, a step above a prison cell. Four bunk beds crammed into a space meant for two, a single fan that looked like it belonged in a museum, and a window that opened onto the alley below.

But it was the "premium" option, which meant two things: a lock on the door (which looked like it could be opened with a credit card) and a "private" locker (which was missing its door entirely).

Marcus claimed the bottom bunk nearest the window - prime real estate. As he unpacked his "budget traveler" gear (a mix of expensive tech and cheap souvenirs designed to look authentic), he noticed something odd.

The mattress had a dark stain on it. Not the usual suspicious hostel stains, but something that looked like... dried blood.

"Housekeeping!" Marcus called, but no one came. He sighed and flipped the mattress. *Some people just can't handle a little authenticity.*

## The Rooftop Introduction

As evening fell, Marcus headed to the rooftop bar, as much for the networking opportunities as for the view. The Bangkok skyline stretched before him, golden temples juxtaposed with neon signs and towering skyscrapers.

The rooftop was already lively. A group was playing a drinking game with what looked like locally brewed moonshine. In the corner, two backpackers were engaged in what appeared to be a serious discussion about "the meaning of travel."

Marcus ordered a Chang beer (when in Rome) and struck up a conversation with the bartender, a woman whose name tag read "Dao."

"First time at The Nest?" she asked, already sounding tired.

"First time in Bangkok," Marcus said, flashing his most charming smile. "But I have a feeling this place and I are going to get along just fine."

Dao gave him a look that suggested she'd heard that before. "Just... be careful on the stairs after dark."

Marcus laughed. "I can handle myself."

As if on cue, Jake appeared, already looking worse for wear. "Hey, Moneybags!" he slurred, clapping Marcus on the back. "You're a lifesaver, mate. Absolute lifesaver."

Marcus patted him on the shoulder. "Happy to help, Jake. That's what the travel community is all about."

## The First Night's Calculations

Back in his bunk, Marcus pulled out his laptop and updated his travel blog. "Just arrived in Bangkok!" he typed. "Already helping fellow travelers with their financial journey. 💰 #TravelSmart #FinancialFreedom"

He scheduled the post for tomorrow - got to maintain the illusion of spontaneity.

As he drifted off to sleep, Marcus's last thoughts were about interest rates and potential new "clients." The distant sounds of the hostel - drunken laughter, creaking stairs, the occasional scream - barely registered.

*This place is perfect,* he thought. *Full of desperate people with more problems than money.*

Little did he know, he'd just signed his own financial - and literal - death warrant.
