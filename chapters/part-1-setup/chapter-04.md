# Chapter 4: The Hostel's Dark History

**POV:** Marcus / Dao / Nok (multiple perspectives)
**Location:** The Wanderer's Nest, Bangkok
**Timeline:** Day 5-6, Various Times
**Word Target:** 5,500

## The Morning After the Fight

**POV: Marcus**

Marcus woke to the sound of whispering. He opened his eyes to see his dorm-mates huddled in the corner, staring at him.

"What?" he snapped, sitting up too quickly. His head spun from the painkillers.

"Nothing," Colin said quickly, but the damage was done. The easy camaraderie was gone.

Marcus looked at his bandaged arm. The blood had seeped through overnight, leaving a rust-colored stain on the sheets.

*Great,* he thought. *Now I'm the hostel pariah.*

## The Breakfast of Shame

**POV: Marcus**

The common room was eerily quiet when Marcus entered. Conversations stopped. Eyes averted.

Even Sleepy, who usually didn't care about anything, gave him a long look. "You okay, boss?"

"Fine," Marcus lied, pouring himself a cup of coffee. The liquid was lukewarm and tasted like dirt.

He sat at an empty table, the weight of stares heavy on his back. The hostel that had once felt like his kingdom now felt like a prison.

## The First @HostelReaper Sighting

**POV: Lena (Swedish backpacker)**

Lena was scrolling through Instagram when she saw it - a new post from @HostelReaper:

"Another traveler learns the hard way: some debts can't be repaid with interest. #The200DollarQuestion #HostelReaper"

The image was a broken Chang beer bottle with "200" written on it in red marker.

"Hey, guys," she said, showing the others. "This is creepy."

Hans leaned in. "What's @HostelReaper?"

"You don't know?" Lena was surprised. "It's this urban legend. Some say it's a person, others say it's... something else. They post about hostel deaths before they happen."

A chill ran through the group.

## The Staff Meeting

**POV: Dao**

Dao called an emergency staff meeting in the basement. The air was thick with the smell of mold and something older, darker.

"We have a problem," she said, looking at Sleepy, Nok, and Big Tony.

"We always have problems," Sleepy said, yawning.

"This is different," Dao insisted. "The staircase... it's waking up."

Nok nodded. "I saw the blood moving last night."

Big Tony crossed himself. "We need to do something."

Sleepy sighed. "Fine. But no police. And no scaring the guests."

## The History Lesson

**POV: Marcus**

Marcus was nursing his coffee when Dao sat down across from him. "We need to talk."

"About what?" Marcus asked, though he already knew.

"About this place," Dao said, her voice low. "About what you're dealing with."

She told him the story:

### The First Death (2008)
A backpacker named Ryan had been running a similar lending scheme. One night, he was found at the bottom of the staircase, his throat slit with a broken beer bottle. The official story was suicide, but the staff knew better.

### The Second Death (2012)
A girl named Sarah had borrowed money from the wrong person. She was found in the same spot, her body arranged like an offering. The graffiti "PAID IN FULL" appeared the next day.

### The Third Death (2016)
A group of backpackers had started a pyramid scheme. When it collapsed, three of them died in the staircase. The hostel was closed for "renovations" for a month.

"Every time," Dao said, "it's about money. Every time, it's in that staircase."

Marcus felt a chill. "That's just... coincidence."

Dao shook her head. "This place... it feeds on greed. On desperation. And right now, you're the main course."

## The Staircase Investigation

**POV: Marcus**

Against his better judgment, Marcus found himself drawn to the staircase. The second-floor landing, where the fight had happened, looked different in the daylight.

The bloodstains were still there, but they seemed... organized. Like they formed a pattern.

He traced the pattern with his finger. It looked like... numbers? "2... 0... 0..."

"What are you doing?"

Marcus jumped. Nok stood behind him, her expression unreadable.

"Nothing," he said quickly, wiping his hand on his pants.

Nok stepped closer. "You should stay away from here."

"Why?" Marcus challenged. "Because of your ghost stories?"

Nok's eyes darkened. "Because the last person who stood there like you... didn't leave alive."

## The Missing Backpacker

**POV: Multiple**

Jake had been gone for two days. No one had seen him since the fight.

"He probably just left," Hans said, but his voice lacked conviction.

"People don't just disappear," Lena argued. "Not without their stuff."

Colin, still nursing his hangover, had a different theory. "What if... what if the hostel got him?"

They all looked at the staircase.

## The Night Terrors Begin

**POV: Marcus**

Marcus woke up screaming.

The dream had been vivid - Jake, standing at the foot of his bed, holding the broken bottle. "You can't hide," Jake had whispered. "The debt always comes due."

He sat up, sweating. The dorm was empty, but the air felt... charged.

Then he saw it. On the wall above his bed, written in what looked like blood: "200."

## The Second @HostelReaper Post

**POV: Lena**

Lena's phone buzzed. Another @HostelReaper post:

"The interest is compounding. Who will pay the price? #TheWanderersNest #Bangkok"

The image was a close-up of the staircase graffiti: "PAID IN FULL" and "INTEREST DUE."

"Guys," Lena said, her voice shaking. "This is getting worse."

## The Confession

**POV: Marcus**

Marcus found Dao in the kitchen. "I need to tell you something."

Dao looked up from her cooking. "I know."

"You know?"

"I know about your... business," Dao said. "I know about the loans. The interest. The threats."

Marcus felt a pang of fear. "What are you going to do?"

Dao sighed. "Nothing. It's not my place. But I will tell you this - you need to stop. Now. Before it's too late."

"Too late for what?"

"Too late to leave," Dao said simply.

## The Lockdown

**POV: Multiple**

That night, the hostel felt different. The air was heavier, the shadows deeper.

Sleepy locked the front door at midnight, something he never did. "No one in or out," he announced.

"Why?" Colin asked.

"Because," Sleepy said, "some debts need to be settled."

## The Whispers in the Dark

**POV: Marcus**

Marcus lay in bed, staring at the ceiling. The hostel was too quiet.

Then he heard it - a whisper. "Marcus..."

He sat up. "Who's there?"

No answer. Just the sound of something... dripping.

He looked at his arm. The bandage was clean, but he could feel the blood beneath it, warm and sticky.

"Marcus..." the whisper came again, closer this time.

He turned on the light. The dorm was empty.

But on the wall, the number had changed. "200" was now "199."

## The Chapter Cliffhanger

As Marcus stared at the number on the wall, he heard a sound from the hallway. Footsteps.

Slow. Deliberate. Coming closer.

The doorknob turned.

Marcus held his breath as the door creaked open.

Standing there, in the dim light, was Jake. But something was... wrong.

His eyes were dark, empty. His smile was too wide, too knowing.

"Hey, Moneybags," Jake said, his voice eerily calm. "Ready to settle up?"

Behind him, in the shadows of the hallway, Marcus thought he saw... something else. Something with too many eyes, too many teeth.
