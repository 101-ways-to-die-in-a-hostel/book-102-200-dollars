# Chapter 3: The First Blood

**POV:** Jake / Marcus / Dao (multiple perspectives)
**Location:** The Wanderer's Nest, Bangkok
**Timeline:** Day 4, 11:37 PM - Day 5, 2:14 AM
**Word Target:** 5,500

## The Confrontation

**POV: Jake**

Jake stood in Marcus's dorm, the broken beer bottle trembling in his hand. The room smelled of sweat, cheap cologne, and something metallic - fear, maybe.

"You're avoiding me," Jake said, his voice low and dangerous.

Marcus forced a laugh. "Avoiding you? Jake, my friend, I've been busy with... business."

"Cut the shit," Jake snapped. "I need more time. My transfer got delayed."

Marcus's smile vanished. "That's not how this works. You signed a contract."

"Fuck your contract!" Jake screamed, slamming the bottle against the wall. Glass shattered, and for a moment, both men froze.

Then Marcus did something stupid. He laughed.

## The First Strike

**POV: Marcus**

Marcus watched as Jake's face twisted with rage. *This could be a problem,* he thought, but his arrogance wouldn't let him back down.

"Easy there, tiger," Marcus said, holding up his hands. "Let's be reasonable."

Jake lunged. Marcus barely dodged, but not before the jagged bottle edge sliced across his forearm. Blood immediately welled up, dripping onto the floor.

*Shit,* Marcus thought. *This is actually happening.*

He tried to retreat, but Jake blocked the door. "You're not going anywhere until we settle this."

## The Hostel Wakes Up

**POV: Dao**

Dao was cleaning the bar when she heard the first scream. She froze, recognizing Marcus's voice.

"Not again," she muttered, grabbing the baseball bat she kept under the counter.

By the time she reached the third floor, the commotion had woken half the hostel. Doors opened, sleepy backpackers peered out, but no one intervened.

"This is none of our business," Hans said, pulling Greta back into their room.

Dao rolled her eyes. *Cowards.*

## The Staircase Showdown

**POV: Jake**

Jake had Marcus cornered in the hallway. Blood dripped from Marcus's arm, but Jake didn't care. The rage was all-consuming.

"You ruined me," Jake hissed. "I can't leave the country. I can't go home. All because of you and your fucking interest rates!"

Marcus tried to reason with him. "Jake, listen. I can help you. We can work something out."

"Like what?" Jake demanded. "More debt? More interest? More of your bullshit?"

Marcus's eyes darted to the staircase. *If I can just get there...*

## The Escape Attempt

**POV: Marcus**

Marcus saw his chance. As Jake ranted, he sidestepped toward the staircase. One step. Two steps. Almost there.

Then Jake noticed.

"Oh no you don't," Jake growled, grabbing Marcus's shirt.

Marcus swung wildly, connecting with Jake's jaw. Jake staggered back, more surprised than hurt.

*Run,* Marcus's brain screamed. He bolted for the staircase.

## The Chase

**POV: Multiple (chaotic perspective)**

The hostel erupted into chaos:
- **Colin** (still drunk): "Oh shit, there's gonna be a murder!"
- **Lena** (terrified): "Someone call the police!"
- **Hans** (excited): "This is better than TV!"
- **Sleepy** (unconcerned): "Meh. Seen worse."

Marcus flew down the stairs, taking them two at a time. Jake followed, cursing and stumbling.

On the second-floor landing, Marcus slipped on something wet. He looked down - blood. *Not mine,* he realized. *Old blood.*

Jake caught up, tackling Marcus onto the bloody landing.

## The First Real Violence

**POV: Jake**

Jake straddled Marcus, pinning him down. The broken bottle was still in his hand, the jagged edge glinting in the dim light.

"Please," Marcus begged. "We can work this out. I'll forgive the debt. Just... don't."

For a moment, Jake hesitated. Then he remembered the humiliation, the fear, the desperation. The bottle came down.

Not hard enough to kill. Just hard enough to draw more blood.

Marcus screamed. A real, primal scream of pain and fear.

## The Hostel's Reaction

**POV: Dao**

Dao reached the second-floor landing just as Jake raised the bottle again. She didn't hesitate.

"ENOUGH!" she screamed, swinging the baseball bat.

It connected with Jake's shoulder, sending him sprawling. The bottle clattered to the floor.

"What the fuck?" Jake yelled, clutching his shoulder.

"This isn't you," Dao said, her voice surprisingly calm. "Go to your room. Sleep it off."

Jake looked at Marcus, bleeding and whimpering on the floor. Then he looked at Dao, her expression unreadable.

Something in him broke. He stood up, stumbled past Dao, and disappeared into the night.

## The Aftermath

**POV: Marcus**

Marcus lay on the landing, blood pooling around him. His arm throbbed where Jake had sliced him, and his face ached where the bottle had connected.

*This wasn't supposed to happen,* he thought. *I'm the smart one. I'm in control.*

Dao knelt beside him. "You need a doctor."

"No," Marcus gasped. "No doctors. No police."

Dao sighed. "You're an idiot."

## The Cleanup

**POV: Nok (the cleaner)**

Nok arrived with her cleaning cart, her expression impassive. She'd seen this before.

"Bandages are in the first aid kit," she said, handing Dao a roll of gauze. "I'll clean up the blood."

As she mopped the landing, she noticed something odd. The old bloodstains on the wall seemed... fresher. Almost like they were bleeding again.

She shook her head. *Too much imagination.*

## The Morning After

**POV: Marcus**

Marcus woke to the sound of his phone buzzing. His arm throbbed, wrapped in a makeshift bandage. His face ached.

He checked his phone. A message from his mother: "Darling, are you sure you're safe? I had a bad dream about you."

Marcus snorted, then winced at the pain. *If only you knew.*

He looked around the dorm. His roommates were gone, probably avoiding him. Smart.

His eyes fell on his smartwatch. The screen was cracked from the fight. *Damn it.*

## The New Reality

**POV: Multiple**

The hostel was different after the fight:
- **Jake** was gone, his bed stripped, his belongings missing
- **Marcus** kept to himself, his usual bravado replaced with nervous glances
- **The backpackers** whispered about "what happened" but no one talked to Marcus
- **The staff** watched everything with new intensity

Even the hostel itself felt different. The staircase seemed darker, the air heavier. The graffiti "PAID IN FULL" now had a second line: "INTEREST DUE."

## The First Blood Ritual

**POV: Dao**

That night, Dao performed a ritual she hadn't done in years. She lit incense at the base of the staircase, murmuring a prayer in Thai.

"I know you're hungry," she said to the darkness. "But not yet. Not him. Not like this."

The shadows seemed to... shift. For a moment, Dao thought she saw eyes in the darkness. Then they were gone.

She shook her head. *Too much stress.*

## The Warning Ignored

**POV: Marcus**

Marcus watched Dao's ritual from the shadows. *Superstitious nonsense,* he thought.

But as he turned to leave, he noticed something. His reflection in the staircase window looked... wrong. His eyes were darker, his smile wider than it should be.

He shook his head. *Too much pain medication.*

## The Foreshadowing Deepens

## The Chapter Cliffhanger

As Marcus lay in bed that night, he heard a sound. A whisper.

"You can't hide forever."

He sat up, heart pounding. The dorm was empty.

"Who's there?" he called, his voice shaking.

No answer. Just the sound of something... dripping.

He looked at his bandaged arm. Fresh blood was seeping through.
